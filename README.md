# LOD-Project
A repository for our Linked Open Data and Knowledge Graphs Project at the TH Cologne for the wintersemester 2022/2023.

The main project idea is to built a Knowledge Graph based on the [Cord-19](https://github.com/allenai/cord19) dataset by combining data with information from [OpenAlex](https://docs.openalex.org/). By combining the underlying data and the additional metadata requested from OpenAlex, a Knowledge Graph concerning information about authors, papers, institutions, journals, research fields and licenses could be built.
